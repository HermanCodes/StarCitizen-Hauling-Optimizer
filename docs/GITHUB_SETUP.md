### Create GitHub Release
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **"Releases"** → **"Create a new release"**
3. Choose tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Release title: `Container Allocator v1.0.0`
5. Upload `deployment/ContainerAllocator.exe` as an asset
6. Use the description from the tag message
7. Click **"Publish release"**

## Step 5: Repository Configuration

### Update Repository Settings
1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. In **"About"** section:
   - Description: `GUI application for optimizing container allocation using linear programming`
   - Website: Link to releases page
   - Topics: `python`, `optimization`, `linear-programming`, `gui`, `logistics`

### Update README Badges
Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` in README.md with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 6: Documentation Structure

Ensure your repository has this structure:
```
container-allocator/
├── src/                    # Source code
├── build-tools/           # Build configuration
├── examples/              # Example configurations
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── deployment/            # Distribution files
├── .gitignore
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── docs/GITHUB_SETUP.md   # This file
```
